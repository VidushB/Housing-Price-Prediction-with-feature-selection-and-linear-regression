# Housing-Price-Prediction-with-feature-selection-and-linear-regression
Using feature selection and analysis techniques on a housing price dataset (from kaggle) to predict the sale prices of houses

## Introduction

This project proposes a simple solution to predict selling prices of houses through feature selection techniques (choosing columns to drop, filling in nulls and normalising and encoding columns). In this project I aim to concentrate on the feature selection process over modelling and represent results as losses and coefficient of determination scores.
An LSTM based time series prediction project to get familiar with LSTMs predictions given a single feature.

## Technologies
All code was run in a google colaboratory notebook.

Python version 3.6
Tensorflow version 2.4.0
Pandas version 1.1.15
Keras version 2.4.3

Running this code requires using google colab with your dataset stored in the linked google drive.

The code uses ideas presented by [Milan Kalkenings](https://www.kaggle.com/milankalkenings/deep-dive-feature-importance-house-prices)

The [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) dataset hosted on Kaggle was used to train my model.
